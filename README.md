# SoftBroom
A little Python script that I made to reorganize folders. It asks you folders you want to clean, and where to relocate files based on their extensions.
In order to execute this script you need to have Python3 installed in your machine. You can achieve that by running this command on terminal:

    sudo apt-get install python3

Then, on the folder you downloaded the script, you can run:

    python3 app.py
